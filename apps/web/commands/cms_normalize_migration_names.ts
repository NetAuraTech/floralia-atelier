/**
 * One-time fixup for the CMS module extraction (ADR-0001, phase 2).
 *
 * Lucid derives the tracked migration name from the file path
 * (`<migrations.path>/<file>`), so moving the five CMS migrations from
 * `database/migrations/` to `database/migrations/cms/` changes their tracked
 * names and Lucid would re-run them on pre-existing databases (and crash on
 * already-existing tables). This command renames the stored `adonis_schema`
 * rows in place, keeping the recorded history aligned with the new locations.
 *
 * Idempotent: rows already renamed are matched by their new name and skipped.
 * Fresh databases never need this command — the migrations simply run from
 * their new location. Safe to delete once every long-lived database has been
 * normalized.
 *
 * @example
 * node ace cms:normalize-migration-names
 * node ace cms:normalize-migration-names --connection=pg
